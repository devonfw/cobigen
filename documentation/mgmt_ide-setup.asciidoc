= IDE setup using Devon IDE


== General Installation Process

First of all you will have to download the Devon IDE from www.devonfw.com. Click on "download" and follow the steps 4.2.1 to 4.2.3. When prompted for a settings URL, simply press enter as no special settings are used.
Following that, you will simply have to wait and follow any instructions given.

After you have executed the steps mentioned above, your install location should look like the picture below.

The next step is to open a console and execute the following command: `+devon project setup cobigen+`
This downloads all the necessary files for Cobigen development.

Now you can open eclipse using the eclipse-main.bat file and import the Cobigen projects you want to work on by clicking File->import...->Maven->Existing Maven Project and entering {Install directory}/workspaces/main/cobigen (Should be the default location when clicking on "Browse...")

== Eclipse Plugin Installation

For some parts of Cobigen, you will have to have additional plugins installed.

=== Plugin development

If you want to develop Cobigen plugins (openapiplugin, javaplugin etc.) you need to install the eclipse PDE plugin. 
To do this, simply open a console in your IDE Install location and execute the command `+devon eclipse add-plugin eclipsepde+`

You will likely get an error here that stems from parts of the plugin being installed by the Devon IDE by default.
This is normally not a problem since Eclipse should prompt you to install missing dependencies when you try to build a relevant project.

=== Eclipse Testing

To properly test Cobigen in an Eclipse environment we use the Eclipse SWTbot which can automate eclipse interactions in a new Eclipse instance.
To install this, open a console in your IDE Install location and  execute the command `+devon eclipse add-plugin eclipsepde+` in a console

You will likely get an error here that stems from parts of the plugin being installed by the Devon IDE by default.
This is normally not a problem since Eclipse should prompt you to install missing dependencies when you try to build or run a relevant project.

=== Optional

==== Template Development

Since Cobigen is a template-based code generator, we have to develop templates. We do this using the template language Freemarker.
It is not necessary to install any plugin though for easier usage we recommend you install an IDE into Eclipse if you do not want to use another platform.

To install an IDE for Freemarker, open a console in your IDE Install location and  execute the command `+devon eclipse add-plugin freemarker+` in a console

==== Script Development

There are some scripts used in Cobigen development that are written in Python.
You may use any platform to write in python you want, but if you want to work in Eclipse, we recommend to install pydev.

You can do this by opening a console in your IDE Install location and executing the command `+devon eclipse add-plugin pydev+` in a console
