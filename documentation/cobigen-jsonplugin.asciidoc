= JSON Plug-in
At the moment the plug-in can be used for merge generic JSOn files depending on the merge strategy defined at the templates.

== Merger extensions
There are currently these merge strategies:

*Generic JSON Merge*

* merge strategy `jsonmerge`(add the new code respecting the existent is case of conflict)
* merge strategy `jsonmerge_override` (add the new code overwriting the existent in case of conflict)

. JsonArray's will be ignored / replaced in total
. JsonObjects in conclict will be processed recursively ignoring adding non existent elements.

== Merge Process

=== Generic JSON Merging

The merge process will be:

. Add non existent JSON Objects from patch file to base file.
. For existent object in both files, will add non existent keys from patch to base object. This process will be done recursively for all existent objects.
. For Json Arrays existent in both files, the arrays will be just concatenated.
