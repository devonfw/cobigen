* As a **user of the Maven integration**, you should focus on the link:cobigen-maven_configuration[Maven configuration] chapter, which guides you through the integration of CobiGen into your build configuration.

* If you like to *adapt the configuration of CobiGen*, you have to step deeper into the link:cobigen-core_configuration[configuration guide] as well as into the plug-in configuration extensions for the link:cobigen-javaplugin[Java Plug-in], link:cobigen-xmlplugin[XML-Plugin], link:cobigen-propertyplugin[Java Property Plug-in], as well as for the link:cobigen-textmerger[Text-Merger Plug-in].
