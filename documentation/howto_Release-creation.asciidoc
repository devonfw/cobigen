= CobiGen Release creation
In this guide we explain how to create CobiGen related releases, i.e. release of a new core version using our useful release automation https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/tree/master/scripts[script].

== Usage
Fire up a command prompt from the CobiGen IDE environment (using `console.bat` for example). Then, you will need to execute the following command: 

[source,bash]
----
python "<path_to_release_script_parent_folder>/create_release.py" -d -g devonfw/cobigen -r "<path_of_your_just_cloned_fork>" -k "yourcapgemini@mail.com" -c
----

NOTE: The CobiGen development environment comes with all required python packages needed for the release script. However, if you encounter errors like `no module named xyz found` you might want to consider running the following command:
[source,bash]
----
python -m pip install -r "<path_to_release_script_parent_folder>/requirements.txt"
