= Property Plug-in
The CobiGen Property Plug-in currently only provides different merge mechanisms for documents written in http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html[Java property syntax].

== Merger extensions
There are two merge strategies for Java properties, which can be configured in the templates.xml:

* Merge strategy `propertymerge` (merges two properties documents and keeps the existing properties on conflicts)
* Merge strategy `propertymerge_override` (merges two properties documents and overrides the existing properties on conflicts)

Both documents (base and patch) will be parsed using the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html[Java 7 API] and will be compared according their keys. Conflicts will occur if a key in the patch already exists in the base document.
