= Cobigen Command line Interface generation

Our new command line interface (CLI) for CobiGen enables the generation of code using few commands. This allows us to decouple CobiGen from Eclipse.

= Commands and options
Using the following command and option you will be able to customize your generation as follows:

• `cobigen,cg` :  Cobigen code generator name.

• `generate`   : This command  stand for generate template .

• `InputGlob`  : The glob pattern of the input file or the whole path of the input file from which the code will be generated.

• `increment`  : specifies an increment ID to be generated. You can specify one single increment with content ALL to generate all increments matching the input(s).

• `--outputRootPath,-out`: The project file path in which you want to generate your code. In small project you don’t need to give a targetPath, cobigen should recognize this and should automatically use this project .

• `template` : specifies a template ID to be generated. You can specify one single template with content ALL to generate all templates matching the input(s).

• `Option -v` : This option is for debug information, verbose log .

• `Option -h` : This option for the help about the selected command.

• `--increment (-i)` : This is for as you want increment you can provide selected list value with comma.

• `--out` : This option is specified the target of generate template .

== CLI Execution step :
First of all need to execute cobigen.bat file .

First of all unzip the cobigen CLI doc file then execute the cobigen.bat file .
after that provide value in below formate .

cobigen generate <inputFile> --out <outputRootPath>

Suppose if you are not providing input file like below then below output will be come .

Below are example of with input file .

image::images/CLIArgumentImage.PNG[Generation path, link="images/CLIArgumentImage.PNG"]

In this image -i is as increment optional ,You can provide option how much increment you want to generate .

Increments: The increment you want to generate, with the option -i , increment list like -i 2,3,4  .

Suppose if not provide any increment then it will be ask to user please provide yours choice increments .
Below are some example .

image::images/WithoutIncrOutPut.PNG[Generation path, link="images/WithoutIncrOutPut.PNG"]
After choose some increment by user like below .

image::images/selectedIncr.PNG[Generation path, link="images/selectedIncr.PNG"]
