= Installation


== IntelliJ setup

If you want to use IntelliJ for CobiGen project, you can follow the steps below:

. You can easily install IntelliJ, create a launch script for it etc. as described in
+
`https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/documentation/intellij.asciidoc`

. After starting IntelliJ, you **need** to import the cobigen folder as maven project

. Next you **have** to configure the maven settings in IntelliJ as follows:

.. Go to `File`-> `Settings` -> `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Build Tools` -> `Maven`
+
--
... **Choose** `(Maven home Path)` from your `devonFolder` -> `devonProjects/software/maven`

... **Override** `(user settings file)` -> `devonProjects/conf/.m2/settings.xml`

... **Override** `(Local repository)` -> `devonProjects/conf/.m2/repository`
--

.. Now go to `File` -> `Project Structure` -> `Project Settings` -> `Project add java sdk version from` -> `devonProjects/software/java`.
+
Make sure you are using Java 11. If you have set up your devonfw-ide with this settings URL `https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen-ide-settings.git`, the correct version will be set automatically. If not, you can download Java 11 manually and place it into `devonProjects/software/java11`.

.. Go to the Maven tool window by clicking on `View` -> `Tool Windows` -> `Maven` and  toggle the "Skip Tests" mode.

After you have finished your configuration, run `maven clean` and `maven install` within IntelliJ. CobiGen should build without any errors.


=== Plugin installation

You can easily install plugins in IntelliJ as described in

`https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html`

==== Adapter for Eclipse Code Formatter

`**If you want to contribute to CobiGen, you must have this plugin installed so that the developer team can use the same coding style.**` This plugin solves the problem of maintaining a common code style in team environments where both IDEA and Eclipse are used. Although it should be enabled and the config file location can be found in devon/workspaces/main as shown below
