= Debugging Cobigen-CLI:

1. Open Debug Configurations by clicking on "Run > Debug Configurations" in Eclipse.

2. Click on "Java Application" and then click on "New".

3. Select the "cli" project and set the Main class to "com.devonfw.cobigen.cli.CobiGenCLI". +

4. Add any arguments that you would normally use when running the CLI.

5. Make sure that every CLI command is valid. You can find an overview of possible commands [here](https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/wiki/howto_Cobigen-CLI-generation#commands-and-options).

6. Under the Arguments tab, set the Working Directory to the path, where CLI is being executed (uses destination of call as root). +

The following steps are only required for debugging tests or remote debugging of CLI. Commands added to arguments can be directly debugged already.

==== Warning:
Without those steps the active cobigen home will be used for the tests! +
With them the tests use a temporary folder instead.

7. Open cobigen.bat and add the following flag +
*-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=1044* +
to the command before "-cp": +

8. Now wait for the console to show "listing for port 1044" and attach the debugger.

9. Go to the Remote Java Application tab in Debug Configurations and click on "New".

10. Select the "cli" project and set the Connection Type to "Standard (Socket Attach)".

11. Set the Host to "localhost" and the Port to the value shown in the screenshot (1044).

12. Save the configuration and start the debugger.


=== Debug System Tests for CLI ===
To debug system tests for the CLI,... 

1. Open the file "cg" located in "Cli > src > main > assembly > resources > bin".

2. Add the marked flag from the screenshot (*-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=1044*) to the file before "-cp".

3. Repeat step 2 for "cg.bat".

4. If you have changed files in core, rebuild the core by running "mvn clean install -f cobigen/ -DskipTests". +
Rebuild the CLI by running "mvn clean install -f cobigen-cli/ -DskipTests" or "./build.sh -dpCcore,cli" in your favorite shell so the files are included in the jar.
