= End to End POC Code generation using OpenAPI
This article helps to create a sample application using cobigen.

== Prerequisites

Download and install devonnfw IDE https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[here],

== Steps to create a Sample Project using Cobigen

The HOW_TO is divided in 2 parts:
[arabic]
. BE-Back End generator (DB + DAO + services) – CONTRACT FIRST APPROACH
. FE-Front End generator (Web App Angular + Ionic App) – CONTRACT FIRST APPROACH

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image9.png[cobigen ionic code genartion]

So, ready to go! We’re going to star

t from the BE part …

=== Back End

run \devonfw-ide-scripts-3.2.4\eclipse-main.bat

It will open eclipse


[arabic, start=6]

create a project using below command from the command prompt

[source, java]
devon java create com.example.domain.myapp


Import the project to eclipse as maven project
image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image14.png[eclipse devon]

Click *FINISH*

Now We have the following 4 projects.

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image15.png[eclipse package explorer]

*BEFORE to start to create an Entity class, remember to create the tables !*

[arabic, start=7]
. Create a new *SQL* *file* (i.e: V0005__CreateTables_ItaPoc.sql) inside __jwtsample-__core and insert the following script:

[source, sql]

CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
id BIGINT auto_increment, modificationCounter *INTEGER* *NOT* *NULL*,
employeeid BIGINT auto_increment,
name VARCHAR(255),
surname VARCHAR(255),
email VARCHAR(255),
PRIMARY KEY (employeeid)
);


*_WARNING_*: please note that there are 2 underscore in the name !

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image16.png[sql file]

[arabic, start=8]
. Now create another SQL file (i.e: V0006__PopulateTables-ItaPoc.sql) and add following script about the INSERT in order to populate the table created before

*_WARNING_*: please note that there are 2 underscore in the name !

[source, sql]
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (id, modificationCounter, employeeid, name, surname,email) VALUES (1, 1, 1, 'Stefano','Rossini','stefano.rossini@capgemini.com');
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (id, modificationCounter, employeeid, name, surname,email) VALUES (2, 2, 2, 'Angelo','Muresu', 'angelo.muresu@capgemini.com');
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (id, modificationCounter, employeeid, name, surname,email) VALUES (3, 3, 3, 'Jaime','Gonzalez', 'jaime.diaz-gonzalez@capgemini.com');

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image17.png[sql insert]


*Let's create the yml file for the code generation*

[arabic, start=9]
. Now create a new file _devonfw.yml_ in the root of your core folder. This will be our OpenAPI contract, like shown below. Then, copy the contents of https://github.com/devonfw/tools-cobigen/blob/master/documentation/files/devonfw_employee.yml[this file] into your OpenAPI. It defines some REST service endpoints and a _EmployeeEntity_ with its properties defined.

*Important:* if you want to know how to write an OpenAPI contract compatible with CobiGen, please read https://github.com/devonfw/tools-cobigen/wiki/cobigen-openapiplugin#usage[this tutorial].

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image18.png[Swagger at OASP4J Project]

[arabic, start=10]
. Right click _devonfw.yml_. CobiGen -> Generate

It will ask you to download the templates, click on _update_:

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image19.png[cobigen generate]

It will automatically download the latest version of _CobiGen_Templates_.

*Attention:* If you want to adapt the CobiGen_Templates, (normally this is not neccessary), you will find at the end of this document a tutorial on how to import them and adapt them!

[arabic, start=11]
. Click on all the option selected as below:

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image20.png[cobigen option selection]

[arabic, start=12]
. Click on finish. Below Screen would be seen. Click on continue

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image21.png[cobigen finish]

*The entire [.underline]#BE layer# structure having CRUD operation methods will be auto generated.*

Some classes will be generated on the api part (_jwtsample-api)_, normally it will be interfaces, as shown below:

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image22.png[be layer]

Some other classes will be generated on the core part (_jwtsample-core)_, normally it will be implementations as shown below:

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image23.png[core folder]

*BEFORE to generate the FE*, please start the Tomcat server to check that BE Layer has been generated properly.

To start a server you just have to right click on _SpringBootApp.java_ -> _run as -> Spring Boot app_

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image24.png[Eclipse run as]

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image25.png[Spring boot run]

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image26.png[Spring boot run]

*BE DONE*

Last but not least: We make a quick REST services test !

See in the application.properties the TCP Port and the PATH

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image27.png[application properties]

Now compose the Rest service URL:

service class path>/<service method path>

* <server> refers to server with port no. (ie: localhost:8081)
* <app> is in the application.propeeties (empty in our case, see above)
* <rest service class path> refers to EmployeemanagementRestService: (i.e: /employeemanagement/v1)
* <service method path>/employee/\{id}  (i.e: for  getEmployee method)


image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image28.png[url mapping]

URL of getEmployee for this example is:

For all employees
[source, URL]
http://localhost:8081/services/rest/employeemanagement/v1/employee/search

For the specific employee
[source, URL]
http://localhost:8081/services/rest/employeemanagement/v1/employee/1


Now download https://www.getpostman.com/apps[Postman] to test the rest services.



Once done, you have to create a POST Request for the LOGIN and insert in the body the JSON containing the username and password _waiter_

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image29.png[postman]

Once done with success (*Status: 200 OK*) …

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image30.png[postman]

… We create a NEW POST Request and We copy the Authorization Bearer field (see above) and We paste it in the Token field (see below)

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image31.png[postman]

and specific the JSON parameters for the pagination of the Request that We’re going to send:

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image32.png[postman]

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image33.png[postman]

Now you can click image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image34.png[postman]

Now you ‘ve to check that response has got *Status: 200 OK* and to see the below list of Employee

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image35.png[postman]

Now that We have successfully tested the BE is time to go to create the FE !

=== Front End

Let’s start now with angular Web and then Ionic app.

==== Angular Web App

[arabic]
.  To generate angular structure, download or clone _*devon4ng-application-template*_ from
[source, URL]
https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-application-template

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image36.png[devon dist folder]

[arabic, start=2]
. Once done, right click on _devonfw.yml_ again (the OpenAPI contract). CobiGen -> Generate
. Click on the selected options as seen in the screenshot:

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image37.png[eclipse generate]

[arabic, start=4]
. Click on Finish

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image38.png[eclipse]

[arabic, start=5]
. The entire ANGULAR structure has been auto generated. The generated code will be merged to the existing.


image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image39.png[angular ee layer]

[arabic, start=6]
. IMPORTANT now you have to add in the *_app-routing.module.ts_* file the next content, as a child of HomeComponent, in order to enable the route of the new generated component

[source, ts]
,\{
path: 'employee',
component: EmployeeGridComponent,
canActivate: [AuthGuard],
},

Following picture explain where to place the above content:

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image40.png[routes]

[arabic, start=7]

. Open the command prompt and execute _devon yarn install_ from the base folder, which would download all the required libraries..


[arabic, start=8]
. Check the file *environment.ts* if the server path is correct. (for production you will have to change also the environment.prod.ts file)

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image42.png[environment]

In order to do that it’s important to look at the application.properties to see the values as PATH, TCP port etc …

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image43.png[configure]

For example in this case the URL should be since the context path is empty the server URLS should be like:

[source, ts]
export const environment = {
production: false,
restPathRoot: 'http://localhost:8081/',
restServiceRoot: 'http://localhost:8081/services/rest/',
security: 'jwt'
};


*Warning*: REMEMBER to set security filed to *jwt* , if it is not configured already.
[arabic, start=9]
. Now run the _*ng serve -o*_ command to run the Angular Application.

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image44.png[]

[arabic, start=10]
. If the command execution is *successful*, the below screen will *appear* and it would be automatically redirected to the url:
[source, URL]
http://localhost:4200/login

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image45.png[]

*WebApp DONE*

==== Ionic Mobile App

[arabic]
.   To generate Ionic structure, download or clone _*devon4ng-application-template*_ from
[source, URL]
https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-ionic-application-template
. Once done, Right click on the *_devonfw.yml_* as you already did before in order to use CobiGen.
. Click on the selected options as seen in the screenshot:

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image46.png[]

[arabic, start=4]
. Click on Finish
. The entire ionic structure will be auto generated.

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image47.png[]

[arabic, start=6]
. Change the server url (with correct serve url) in environment.ts, environment.prod.ts and environment.android.ts files (i.e: itapoc\devon4ng-ionic-application-template\src\environments\).

The angular.json file inside the project has already a build configuration for android.

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image48.png[]

[arabic, start=7]
. Run npm install in the root folder to download the dependecies
. Run ionic serve

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image49.png[]

[arabic, start=11]
. {blank}
+

Once the execution is successful


image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image50.png[]

* Mobile App DONE*

So: well done

Starting from an Entity class you’ve successfully generated the Back-End layer (REST, SOAP, DTO, Spring services, Hibernate DAO), the Angular Web App and the Ionic mobile App!

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image51.png[]



===== Build APK

Since We’re going to create apk remember the following pre-conditions:

* https://gradle.org/install/[Gradle]
* https://developer.android.com/studio[Android Studio]
* https://developer.android.com/studio/#command-tools[Android sdk]
* https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/getting-started/[Capacitor]


[arabic]
. Now, open cmd and type the path where your _devon4ng-ionic-application-template_ project is present.
. Run the following commands:
[loweralpha]
.. npx cap init
.. ionic build --configuration=android
.. npx cap add android
.. npx cap copy
.. npx cap open android
. Build the APK using Android studio.

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image52.png[]
image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image53.png[]
image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image54.png[]
image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image55.png[]

You can find your apk file in

/devon4ng-ionic-application-template/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug

== Adapt CobiGen_Templates

After following this tutorial, you will have the CobiGen_Templates downloaded on your local machine. To import these templates you need to do the following:

Right click in any part of the package explorer, then click on CobiGen -> Adapt templates

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image56.png[]

Click _Ok_:

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image57.png[]

Now the CobiGen_Templates project will be automatically imported into your workspace, as shown on the image below:

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image58.png[]

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image59.png[]

Now you just need to change the Java version of the project to JRE 1.8. Right click on the JRE system library, and then on _Properties:_

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image60.png[]

Now change the version to Java 1.8
image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image61.png[]

Now you have successfully imported the CobiGen templates. If you want to edit them, you will find them in the folder _src/main/templates._ For instance, the Java templates are located here:

image:images/howtos/e2e_gen/image62.png[]

Now you can adapt the templates as much as you want. Documentation about this can be found on:
