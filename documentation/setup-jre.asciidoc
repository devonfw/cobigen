= Set up JRE for development

Cobigen is supposed to support both java 8 and java 11 even though we are moving to 11. Here is a short description of how to setup the execution enviromment for developing so that you can test both environments.

By default, cobigen development tools come with some installed JREs in /software/java (11) and /software/java/additionalJdk (7 and 8)

In cobigen, there is a fixed setup of JAVASE-1.8 in maven, which leads to the odd that no matter which Java is currently used, eclipse keeps showing JAVASE-1.8. A temporary reconfiguration of JRE in build path will also be overwritten by a maven update.

Eclipse has a fixed list of execution environments, which is automatically matched with the current most suitable installed JRE, in our case JDK-8 by default. The matching JRE is the actual one, which is used to compile no matter which name eclipse shows

As that, to move to 11, just setup the match JRE of JAVASE-1.8 to 11 or any version you need
