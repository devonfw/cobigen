= IDE Setup with the Oomph Installer


[WARNING]
===============================
This page is still under construction.
===============================


As an alternate and faster way to set up Eclipse for CobiGen development we also provide an customized Eclipse Installer and Oomph setups.

. The installer can be downloaded http://de-mucevolve02/files/oomph/installer/releases/[from within the corp network].
. Unarchive it in a folder of your choice (e.g. `%home%\Eclipse Installer Capgemini\` if you want to use the installer frequently)
. Run `eclipse-inst.exe` or `eclipse-inst` on linux

[WARNING]
===============================
Before starting the installation make sure to

. have `git` configured for your prefered github authentication method
. have `git` configured to handle long file names (e.g. by setting `git config --system core.longpaths true`)
. have reading access to http://de-mucevolve02/ in the corp network
===============================

== Quick start guide
. On the Product page choose `CobiGen IDE`
. On the Project page choose `CobiGen`
.. `master` clones only the master branch from the specified origin
.. `development` clones all development branches and the master branch from the specified origin into `%installation location%/workspaces/cobigen-development` and the master branch from the devonfw repository into `%installation location%/workspaces/cobigen-master`

== Detailed Walkthrough

=== Clean (with Eclipse installation)

On the first installer page you need to choose what Eclipse bundle you want to use. The _Product page_ (picture below) displays the possible choices.
image:images/howtos/ide-setup-oomph/01_installer.png[Product page of the installer]

. the current Product Catalog. Each entry represents a pre-configured Eclipse bundle. In case of doubt choose _ConiGen IDE_
. the Eclipse version to be installed.
. the bitness of the Eclipse version. Be sure to choose the bitness of your OS
. the Java VM used _during_ installation.
. the bundle pool. If activated Eclipse will create a p2 pool. This can be helpfull if you want to create multiple installations of eclipse. This option is hidden and deactivated by default. You can make it visible by removing the `-Doomph.p2.pool=@none` line in the installers `eclipse-inst.ini`
. the update indicator. If those arrows spin you can update the installer or any of it's components by clicking on this button
. Chooses the selected product and continues with the installation

The next installer page lets you choose a project to be checked out during installation.

. the current Project Catalog. Select _CobiGen_
. the project stream. In case of _CobiGen_:
.. `master`: Only the master branch of Cobigen will be checked out
.. `development`: the master branch and ALL development branches will be checked out.
.. In each case you can specify an own fork as git origin

After choosing a project the installer fetches additional Oomph tasks. You need to accept the installation of said tasks in order to proceed.

The installer restarts then and open at the _Project page_ again. Simply repeat the instructions for the _Project page_. Installation and restart is only done the first time a new task is requested by a product or project configuration.

By proceeding with the _Next_ button the installer opens the _Variables page_. On this page the installation and configuration of the Eclipse bundle and the chosen projects is done by setting the variables presented.

image:images/howtos/ide-setup-oomph/04_installer.png[Variable page of the installer]

. the folder in that Eclipse will be installed into. It is recommended to use the _Browse..._ button to locate the folder. A direct input into the text field is possible but due to a randomly occuring bug in the installer the input is only partially parsed.
. the User name to access the _Devon Maven Nexus_. Typically your corp user name. This value will be stored in `variables-customized(.bat)`
. the password to access the _Devon Maven Nexus_. Typically your corp password. This value will be stored (*PLAIN!*) in `variables-customized(.bat)`
. the User name to access the _iCSD Fileserver_. This value will be stored in `variables-customized(.bat)`. If no credentials were provided insert anything.
. the password to access the _iCSD Fileserver_. This value will be stored (*PLAIN!*) in `variables-customized(.bat)`. If no credentials were provided insert anything.
. the Github remote URI for cloning the devonfw repository of _CobiGen_. Target of this URI is `%installation location%/workspaces/cobigen-master` if the chosen stream is `development`.
.. `SSH`: The remote URI to access the repository via ssh. Make sure to have your `git` configured to work with a ssh client and have this client running
.. `HTTPS`: The remote URI to access the repository via https. Activiates the `Github user ID` and `Github user Password` variables. User id and password are stored in the cloning scripts in *plain* text.
.. Two-Factor-Authentifications aren't supported and probably won't be in the future
. the Github remote URI for cloning a CobiGen repository.
.. `Existing own fork (SSH)`: Same as above. The `Github user ID` is used in the remote URI instead of `devonfw`. Activates and requires the `Github user ID` variable.
.. `Existing own fork (HTTPS)`: Same as above. The `Github user ID` is used in the remote URI instead of `devonfw`.
.. `devonfw repository`: Uses the remote URI from above.
. The Eclipse version you want to develop cobigen for. This is *not* the Eclipse version to be installed. When running integration tests for the CobiGen Eclipse Plugin this Eclipse version is launched.
. Your Github user id.
. Your Github user password. Be aware that this is stored in plain text! Moreover, if you use special characters as for example ! or % in your password, you need to escape them in the batch file. See http://www.robvanderwoude.com/escapechars.php for further information.
. Reveals all variables that can be setted. Activated by default. If not activated preset variables and variables with default values are hidden.

The _Next_ button can only be used if *all* variables are set. Proceeding the installer opens the _Confirmation page_. All tasks needed for installation are shown here with all variables resolved. Only the tasks needed for the installation are activated. Tasks like _Project import_ are triggered at first startup of Eclipse.

The _Finish_ button triggers the installation process. Once started the installation proceeds automatically.

. indiciates the task that is currently executed
. the task output. Provides progress and debugging information
. if activated the installer exits after successfull installation
. stops the installation

=== Into an existing Eclipse installation

The following instructions only hold for OASP4J-like Eclipse installations. Furthermore you need to install `Oomph Setup` from the http://download.eclipse.org/oomph/updates/milestone/latest[Oomph Update site]. When _Oomph_ is installed activate the Oomph tool bar via the _Show tool bar contributions_ check box.

The tool bar looks like this: image:images/howtos/ide-setup-oomph/08_tool-bar.png[Oomph tool bar]
