==  Installation

* https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/wiki/cobigen-eclipse_installation[For eclipse users]

==  Architecture

https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/wiki#architecture[CobiGen is build as an extensible framework for incremental code generation...]

== Repository Organization

The CobiGen repository is organized in a one-branch-per-plugin schema. By that, we can release each plug-in continously and independently without side effects. On release the plug-in branch is merged to master branch such that you will find all the latest releases of each plug-in on the master branch.

|===
| Top-level folder | Description

| `cobigen-documentation`      | Contains git submodules for building and tagging the wiki. 

| `cobigen-eclipse`      | Contains the cobigen eclipse bundles. The implementation of the plug-in is driven in `cobigen-eclipse/cobigen-eclipse` folder.  

| `cobigen-maven` | Contains the maven plug-in implementation.     

| `cobigen-review` | Project to be used for https://github.com/AgileReview-Project/AgileReview-Legacy-Plugin[AgileReview] 

| `cobigen-templates` | Contains template sets for different architectures 

| `cobigen` | Containts the code implementation of CobiGen as well as all plug-in implementations besides the eclipse plug-in and maven plug-in 

| `ide-settings` | Contains the shared settings processed by the https://github.com/oasp/oasp4j-ide[oasp4j-ide]
|===

== Build

You can build CobiGen core as well as each plug-in besides the eclipse plug-in separately by stepping into the plug-in folder, e.g. for the Java plug-in you could step into `cobigen/cobigen-javaplugin` and run `mvn clean install` to build the plug-in and deploy it into your local repository.

The CobiGen eclipse plug-in can build build by running `mvn clean package -Pp2-build-photon`. The profile `p2-build-photon` builds the eclipse plug-in by retrieving eclipse photon bundles as dependencies. Without specifying the profile, the build will fail. An exception to this is the cobigen-eclipse-test project, which has to be built using `mvn clean package -Pp2-build-photon,p2-build-stable,p2-build-experimental`.

== Deploy

CobiGen deployment has to be distinguished threefold

|===
| Component | Deployment Type | Commands

|  `cobigen/cobigen-core/`,`cobigen-maven/` | MAVEN | `mvn clean deploy`

|  `cobigen/cobigen-*/` (except core). In case of deploying dev_javaplugin or dev_openapiplugin, go to `cobigen/cobigen-*-parent/cobigen-*`| ECLIPSE | ```# Builds the Manifest and bundles the dependencies
mvn clean package bundle:bundle -Pp2-bundle
# Uses the created bundle and builds a p2 update site for it. Do NOT use clean
mvn install bundle:bundle -Pp2-bundle,p2-build-photon,p2-build-experimental p2:site
# Uploades the p2 update site to the experimental repository. Do NOT use clean
mvn deploy -Pp2-build-photon,p2-build-experimental -Dp2.upload=experimental
```

| `cobigen-eclipse/` | ECLIPSE | `mvn clean deploy -Pp2-build-photon,p2-build-experimental -Dp2.upload=experimental`

== Debugging with Maven

To debug Maven builds on any plug-in:

. Step into the plug-in and start a console there.
. Run `mvnDebug clean install`, it will output the port the debugger is listening to.
. On Eclipse, right click your project -> Debug as -> Debug Configurations...
. Add a new Remote Java Application that connects on a socket on the port that was outputted by Maven.
. Hit debug and have fun!

To debug Maven tests follow https://doc.nuxeo.com/corg/how-to-debug-a-test-run-with-maven/[this link]
